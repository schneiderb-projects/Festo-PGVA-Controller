# Festo-PGVA-Controller
Python interface to Control Festo PGVA via Modbus TCP

This contains the code and logic to control a Festo PGVA box on the same network. It was designed to be used with a Festo PGVA and a Festo Openloop pipette wired to the 24v logic output of the PGVA.

If using the setup described, the interface allows for the PGVA box to be controlled from your computer as long as they are on the same network.
